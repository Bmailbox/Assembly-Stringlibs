# Assembly-Stringlibs
A work in progress for a string library written in Assembly, based off the ARM architecture instruction set

This library is designed to replicate various string functions found in languages such as C++ or Python using the ARM architecture instruction set. 
This project is still a work in progress and I dont know when I'll ever get back to it.
